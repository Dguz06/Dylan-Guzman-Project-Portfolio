Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I like to think my portfolio acts as an insight into my life. My voluntary projects tend to include the
use of MLB data, as I am a passionate fan of the league. These projects are a way for me to explore any curiosity I may have about the game. 
Also included is a movie reccomendation tool I made as a class assignment. This demonstrates my capabilities to code in aspects that don't 
involve data. This portfolio will be updated as I complete more projects. Thank you for viewing my work. 

Sincerely,
Dylan Guzman
