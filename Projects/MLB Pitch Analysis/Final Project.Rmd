Importing and cleaning datasets. 

```{r}
# Importing data sets and libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)

data <- read.csv("C:/Users/dylz3/Downloads/6_5-6_19 4Seam data - Sheet1.csv")
head(data)


# Renaming columns
data <- data %>% rename(Pitch_MPH = Pitch..MPH.,
                        Game_date = Game.Date,
                        Perceived_velocity = Perceived.Velocity,
                        RPM = Spin.Rate..RPM.,
                        Downward_movement_gravity = Downward.Movement.w..Gravity..in.,
                        Vertical_movement = Vertical.Movement.w.o.Gravity..in.,
                        Exit_velocity = EV..MPH.)

# Four rows had NA as its exit velocity. 
data <- data %>% filter(is.na(Exit_velocity) == FALSE)


# Some pitches have been tracked incorrectly, I am getting rid of those pitches
# here. 
data <- data %>% filter(RPM > 0)

# I got rid of results that were sac bunts, because they are purposely
# always slow, it would skew the regression. 
data <- data %>% filter(Result != "Sac Bunt")

head(data)
```



Visualizations
```{r}
# Visualizations to see shape of data (Histograms)
hist(data$Exit_velocity, col = "green", xlab = "Exit Velocity (MPH)",
     main = "Exit Velocity Histogram")

     main = "Pitch Velocity Histogram")
hist(data$Vertical_movement, col = "lightblue", xlab = "Vertical Movement (in)",
     main = "Vertical Movement Histogram")


# Visualizations to see regression (Scatterplots)
data %>% ggplot(aes(x = Exit_velocity, y = Vertical_movement)) + 
  geom_point(colour = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Vertical Movement Vs. Exit Velocity",
       x = "Exit Velocity (MPH)",

Regression analysis
```{r}
# Corr Table

                                   Vertical_movement)

# Regression summary

MPH_model <- lm(Exit_velocity ~ Pitch_MPH, data=data)
RPM_model <- lm(Exit_velocity ~ RPM, data=data)
VM_model <- lm(Exit_velocity ~ Vertical_movement, data=data)

summary(RPM_model)
summary(VM_model)

Machine Learning Model
```{r}
# ML Test

# Plotting residuals

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
